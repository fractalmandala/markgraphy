  Picks and writes markdown graphs (ASCII-framed Svelte components for
  SvelteKit and mdsvex) next to prose. Chooses a component from the
  fractalgraphy library, writes real Svelte usage, and never draws SVG,
  Mermaid, Chart.js, canvas, or ASCII art. Use when explaining a refactor,
  incident, postmortem, tradeoff, pull request, sprint, or migration; when the
  user mentions markdown graphs, ASCII diagrams, framed charts, GraphFlow, or
  GraphTimeline; or when a write-up would scan faster with a figure.
---

# markdown graphs

fractalgraphy components draw charts with characters: a dashed frame, \`+\`
corners, and a \`[ TITLE ]\` on the top edge. Svelte 5, zero dependencies. The
package installs from npm and the components are imported — nothing is copied
into your project.

## When to use

A figure earns its place when the writing has shape: a path, a night, a
matrix, a diff, a countdown. One sentence → no graph. Before a wall of
bullets, ask if a framed figure would scan faster.

## Install

\`\`\`bash
pnpm add fractalgraphy
\`\`\`

Svelte 5 is the only peer. No CSS import, no config — theming is CSS
variables (below). If the import does not resolve, the package is missing.

Read recipes.md before writing usage. Unsure which component? Fetch
${SITE_URL}/llms.txt.

## Procedure

1. Decide if a figure earns it. One sentence → no graph. A path, a night, a matrix, a diff → yes.
2. Pick **at most two** graphs from the chooser. Prefer a pair in recipes.md.
3. Confirm the package is installed. Then write the usage — swap labels, keep the API.
4. Write the reply in this shape. Do not lead with the figure.

\`\`\`
1–3 sentences (the claim)

<GraphA … />

1–3 sentences (what the second figure adds)

<GraphB … />
\`\`\`

5. Check the rules. Then send.

## Chooser

Writing first. Data shape if nothing matches.

| The writing is             | Use                                              | Recipe       |

| Pick A vs B                | \`GraphCompare\`, then \`GraphRank\` if size matters | Pick one     |

Skip the frame primitives (\`Graph\`, \`GraphBody\`, \`GraphRule\`, \`GraphTrack\`,
\`GraphTick\`, \`GraphArrow\`) unless you are assembling a custom figure.

## Import

In a \`+page.svelte\` (or any component):

\`\`\`svelte
<script>
	import { GraphFlow } from 'fractalgraphy';
<\/script>

<GraphFlow title="AUTH" rows={[{ nodes: [{ label: 'request' }, { label: 'handler' }] }]} />
\`\`\`

In an \`.svx\` markdown file (mdsvex), imports go in the script block at the
top, then the component sits next to the prose:

\`\`\`mdsvex
<script>
	import { GraphMeter } from 'fractalgraphy';
<\/script>

Prose before the figure.

<GraphMeter title="ROWS" value={0.67} caption="users table" />
\`\`\`

Named exports match the component names: \`Graph<Name>\`. There is no default
export.

## Component cheat sheet

All 29 graphs. \`title\` is required and drawn as \`[ TITLE ]\` — uppercase,
1–2 words. \`palette\` / \`glyphs\` exist only on drawing graphs.

## Theme

Set CSS variables on any container. Dark-first — components assume a dark
page and pick these up wherever they are scoped.

| Variable             | Default                  | Use                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| \`--graph-foreground\` | \`oklch(0.93 0 0)\`        | primary text                         |
| \`--graph-muted\`      | \`oklch(0.62 0 0)\`        | secondary text                       |
| \`--graph-accent\`     | \`oklch(0.78 0.17 155)\`   | the one highlight                    |
| \`--graph-accent-2\`   | \`oklch(0.78 0.12 70)\`    | second series (\`palette="duo"\`)      |
| \`--graph-accent-3\`   | \`oklch(0.75 0.1 200)\`    | third series (\`palette="multi"\`)     |
| \`--graph-frame\`      | \`oklch(0.6 0 0 / 0.5)\`   | frame dashes and corner marks        |
| \`--graph-faint\`      | \`oklch(0.3 0 0)\`         | empty cells and tracks               |
| \`--graph-font\`       | mono stack               | the font — anything monospace works  |

\`\`\`css
:root {
	--graph-accent: oklch(0.78 0.17 155);
}
\`\`\`

## Motion

Motion is already in the components: a \`reveal\` action fades and rises each
row or track once, when it scrolls into view. Transform + opacity only,
~220ms, and \`prefers-reduced-motion\` sets the duration to 0. Do not add
loops, pulses, or CSS animation.

## Rules

- At most two graphs in a section. Prose between them. Never a gallery.
- Titles: 1–2 words, uppercase, no punctuation. Drawn as \`[ TITLE ]\`.
- Labels: lowercase, plain (\`auth middleware\`, not \`AuthMiddleware Layer\`).
- Copy props from recipes.md or the docs. Do not invent APIs, extra hues, or chart libraries.
- Default is one accent (\`--graph-accent\`). \`palette="duo"\` / \`"multi"\` only when a second or third series needs it.
- Unused rows recede (~0.4 opacity). Numbers: \`tabular-nums\`, right-aligned.

## Do not

- Draw SVG, Mermaid, Chart.js, canvas, or Markdown ASCII art if the component exists.
- Restyle the frame (no extra borders, no rounded cards, no new corner marks).
- Dump every graph you know into one reply.
- Use a pie chart. Stack or Waffle.
- Pass \`palette\` on Table, Invoice, Spec, Stat, Tree, or the frame primitives.

## Example prompts

These are user messages. Match the pair, copy usage from the recipe, swap in their labels.
