# fractalgraphy component manifest

Full parity with the reference library (`ref/`, markdown-graphs). One dashed frame (`Graph`), one accent, glyphs draw everything, no SVG, zero dependencies.

Status values: `implemented — pending user evaluation` / `assigned` / `planned`.

## Frame (src/lib/frame/)

| Unit | Reference source | What it proves | Status |
