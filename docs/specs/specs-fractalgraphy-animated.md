# fractalgraphy animated set

Ideated 2026-08-30 and built by five parallel agents; each unit keeps the glyph-only, one-accent, reduced-motion-safe contract. Lives in `src/lib/animated/`. Status values: `implemented — pending user evaluation`.

## Contract (shared by all units)

- **--graph-* tokens only.** No hex accents; the site accent picker re-themes all of them.
- **Glyph whitelist.** Art uses ASCII plus U+2500-259F only (the set Geist Mono actually covers — see specs-fractalgraphy-diagrams.md). No `▲▼→←●○◆■`, no braille.
- **Character-grid discipline.** No letter-spacing or padding inside art; in-art font weights ≤ 600.
- **Reduced motion.** `animated={false}` or `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` freezes each unit at a meaningful static state (full text, first window, developed frame). Explicit user playback (play/step buttons) still works.
- **Determinism.** mulberry32 PRNG seeds (`seedNum`) reproduce boards/burns/rain and keep SSR HTML identical to first client paint.
